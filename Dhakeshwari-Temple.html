                                        Dhakeshwari National Temple (Bengali: ঢাকেশ্বরী জাতীয় মন্দির, romanized: Ðhakeshshori Jatio Mondir) is a Hindu temple in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It is state-owned, giving it the distinction of being Bangladesh's 'National Temple'. The name "Dhakeshwari" (ঢাকেশ্বরী
                                        Ðhakeshshori) means so called "Goddess of Dhaka". Since the destruction of Ramna Kali Mandir in 1971 by the Pakistan Army during the Bangladesh Liberation War, the Dhakeshwari Temple has assumed status as the most
                                        important Hindu place of worship in Bangladesh.[1]It is also the largest Hindu temple in Bangladesh.This temple is part of the famous Shakti Peethas in Indian Subcontinent. Here the gem of sati's crown had fallen.
                                        <br><br> The Dhakeshwari temple was built in the 12th century by Ballal Sen, a king of the Sena dynasty, and it is said that the city was named after the Goddess.[3] The current architectural style of the temple
                                        cannot be dated to that period because of the numerous repairs, renovations and rebuilding which have taken place over time. It is considered an essential part of Dhaka's cultural heritage. Many researchers[who?]
                                        believe that the temple is also one of the Shakti Peethas, where the jewel from the crown of the Goddess Sati had fallen. Although there is not enough historical context to establish this as a fact, researchers
                                        have been directed to this site while trying to locate the particular Shakti Peetha. Since ages, the temple has been held in great importance. The original 800-year-old murti was taken to Kumartuli, Kolkata, West
                                        Bengal, India. During the partition of India, she was brought to Kolkata from Dhaka with millions of refugees. By 1950, the businessman Debendranath Chaudhary built the temple of Goddess in Kumortuli area and established
                                        some of the Goddess' property for her daily services. The idol is 1.5 feet tall, has ten arms, mounted on her lion in the form of Katyani Mahishasurmardini Durga. On her two sides are Laxmi, Saraswati, Kartik and
                                        Ganesh. A Tiwari family from Azamgarh was appointed by the royal family for daily worship of the deity. In 1946, the descendants of that family came to Calcutta and were re-appointed, where they still serve the
                                        Goddess continuously.
                                        <br><br> Current presiding deity here in Dhakeshwari Temple is the replica of original idol. Original Original: The Goddess statue at the Dhakeshwari Mata Temple in Kolkata Replica Replica: The Goddess statue at
                                        the Dhakeshwari Temple Dhakeswori Mata Idol in Kolkata and Dhaka It is widely believed[according to whom?] that the Queen, wife of King Bijoy Sen went to Langolbond for bathing. On her way back she gave birth to
                                        a son, known to historians as Ballal Sen. After ascending to the throne, Ballal Sen built this temple to glorify his birthplace. Legends say that Ballal Sen once dreamt of the deity covered under the jungle. Ballal
                                        Sen uncovered the deity from there and built a temple, named for Dhakeswari. Whatever the legends describe, Hindus consider Dhakeswari to be the presiding deity of Dhaka, which is an incarnation or form of Goddess
                                        Durga the Adi Shakti. The idol of Durga is called Dhakeswari .
                                        <br><br> It was severely damaged during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, and over half of the temple's buildings were destroyed. The main worship hall was taken over by the Pakistan Army and used as an ammunitions
                                        storage area. In 2018,the Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina visited the Dhakeshwari Temple and announced gifting of adjacent land to the temple authorities. Over the years the temple lost a lot of its property
                                        to land grabbing, but recently, under Hasina's directions the government mediated an agreement to hand over the land to the temple authorities.

                                    The Ramna Kali Mandir (Bengali: রমনা কালী মন্দির) was a temple in Dhaka begun in the time of the Mughal Empire. It was also known as the "Ramna Kalibari". The temple is dedicated to the Hindu Goddess Kali. It was beside the former Dhaka Racecourse, now
                                    Suhrawardy Udyan. The entire temple complex occupied almost 2.25 acres (9,100 m2) and was on the south side of Ramna Park, opposite the Bangla Academy. The temple was destroyed on March 27, 1971 by the Pakistani Army
                                    during the Bangladesh Liberation War. It was the site of a massacre of mostly Hindu people.
